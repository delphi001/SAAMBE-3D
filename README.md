#  SAAMBE-3D: Predicting Effect of Mutations on Proteinâ€“Protein Interactions.
# About
SAAMBE-3D is a tool written in python 3, it is tested to work with python3.7. SAAMBE-3D implements a structure based mathod for predicting the binding free energy change for protein-protein due to a point-mutation. It requires the 3D structure in PDB of the protein-protein complex as input and information about the mutation to make the prediction.
##### SAMMBE 3D can be used to :
- i) predict the binding free energy change caused by single mutation, and 
- ii) predict whether a particular mutation is disruptive or non-disruptive.

# Dependepcies
SAAMBE-3D requires following packages and mentioned versions to be installed in the python to work
- numpy (1.21.5)
- prody (2.4.0)
- xgboost (1.0.2)

# Prediction Models
The method provides two different models for predictions:
- regression.model (for predicting: binding free energy change)
- classification.model (for prediction: if the mutation is disruptive or non-disruptive)

# How to run
The SAAMBE-3D can be run for a single point mutation by executing following command from inside of the SAAMBE-3D directory:
```sh
python saambe-3d.py -i PDBfile -c Chain -r Resid -w wild -m mutation -d model 
```
To make predictionsof a list of point-mutations execute:

```sh
saambe-3d.py -i PDBfile -f mutation_list -d model
```
# Example
##### Single point-mutation: 
For example if user want to predict binding free energy for protein-protein complex with PDB ID 1A22 due to mutation from Cysteine (C) to Alanine (A) at res ID 182 in chain A, they should run the script by typing

```sh
python saambe-3d.py -i 1A22.pdb -c A -r 182 -w C -m A -d 1
```
#### List of point-mutations. 
If user want to get multiple predictions for many single mutations at the same complex, user can provide a file
say `mutations_list.txt`, which should be formatted as follows for the above example.
The columns in the mutation list file are: `ChainID` `resID` `wildtype_residue` `mutant_residue`
```sh
A 182 C A   
```
and the command will be: 
```sh
python saambe-3d.py -i 1A22.pdb -f mutations_list.txt -d 1
```
#
Similarly. for predicting disruptive/non-disruptive mutation, user can type the same command, just need to change the model from 1 to 0
```sh
python saambe-3d.py -i 1A22.pdb -c A -r 182 -w C -m A -d 0 
```
OR
```sh
python saambe-3d.py -i 1A22.pdb -f mutations_list.txt -d 0
```
The 'mutations_list.txt' will be exactly same.
